### 3. Comparison Methods

Three comparison methods available:

1. **Exact Comparison** (Default)

   - Best for: ID fields, categorical data, precise text matching

2. **Fuzzy Comparison**
   - Uses similarity matching (80% threshold)
   - Best for: Text with minor variations, typos, formatting differences

3. **Numeric Threshold Comparison**
   - Considers numeric values equal within a threshold (default: 0.001)
   - Best for: Floating-point numbers, financial data with rounding

### 4. Highlighting and Visualization

**Color Coding:**
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Differences/Changes
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Matches/Unchanged

**Visualization Types:**
- Summary metrics dashboard

## How to Use

### Standard Two-File Comparison

1. **Upload Files:**
   - In the sidebar, select "Two Files (Standard)" mode
   - Upload your first Excel file
   - Upload your second Excel file

2. **Select Sheets:**
   - Choose which sheet to compare from each file
   - Both sheets should have similar structure

3. **Compare:**
   - Click "ðŸ“Š Compare Files" button
   - View results in multiple tabs:
     - Visual Comparison (highlighted differences)
     - Detailed Results (comparison matrix)
     - Statistics (charts and graphs)
     - Differences & Matches (detailed tables)

4. **Export:**
   - Download Excel report with all findings
   - Copy summary to clipboard

### Multi-File Version Tracking

1. **Upload Files:**
   - In the sidebar, select "Multiple Files (3+)" mode
   - Upload your Excel files in chronological order
     - Oldest version first
     - Newest version last
   - Files should have the same sheet structure

2. **Select Sheet:**
   - Choose which sheet to compare across all files
   - Must exist in all uploaded files

3. **Compare Versions:**
   - Click "ðŸ”„ Compare All Versions" button
   - View comprehensive results in tabs:
     - **Version Timeline**: Match percentage trends
     - **Pairwise Comparisons**: Consecutive version differences
     - **Change Tracking**: Cell-level history
     - **Statistics**: Multi-file analytics

4. **Export:**
   - Click "ðŸ“¥ Export All Data" to download:
     - All version data
     - Complete change history
     - Summary statistics

### Natural Language Queries

Use natural language to perform analyses:

**Example Queries:**
- "Compare these two files and highlight differences in yellow, matches in green"
- "Show me all rows where values are different between files"
- "Find matching values in both datasets"
- "Highlight cells that don't match between sheets"
- "Compare data and show summary statistics"

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Accurate Comparisons:

1. **Consistent Structure:**
   - Ensure files have the same column names
   - Keep data types consistent across versions

2. **Chronological Order:**
   - For multi-file tracking, upload files in time order
   - Use consistent naming (e.g., file_v1, file_v2, file_v3)

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Remove empty rows/columns before uploading
   - Ensure column headers are in the first row

4. **Version Labels:**
   - Use descriptive file names (e.g., "products_2024_01.xlsx")
   - Include dates or version numbers in filenames

### Performance Considerations:

- **File Size:** Works best with files under 1MB
- **Number of Files:** Optimal performance with 3-10 files
- **Rows:** Handles up to 10,000 rows efficiently
- **Columns:** Works well with up to 100 columns

### Understanding Results:

**Match Percentage:**
- 100% = Files are identical
- 90-99% = Minor differences
- 70-89% = Moderate differences
- Below 70% = Significant differences

**Change Rate (Multi-File):**
- Shows % of cells that changed across versions
- Higher % indicates more volatility
- Track specific columns for targeted analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No common columns found"**
- Ensure files have matching column names
- Check for extra spaces in column headers
- Verify sheet names are correct

**"Not enough data to compare"**
- Ensure selected sheet exists in all files
- Check that sheets contain data

**"Shape mismatch warning"**
- Files have different number of rows/columns
- Comparison will still work (using common columns)
- Review compatibility warnings
